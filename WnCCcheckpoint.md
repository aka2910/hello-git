# WnCC Checkpoint 
### CNN and it's Application 

As of now we have learnt quite a lot about ML and other programming skills like git & github. We are following the Andrew Ng's course on coursera. 
Also,Mentors assign us to watch some weeks of the course and then provided an Assignment based on it. Our target is to complete the learning phase by midSem.
After that we have planned to start the implementation of the theory in two projects, for that we will be divided into two groups.

Upto the first Assignment we learnt basic Python including numPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, openCV. We also learnt basic git and github.
In the second Assignment we implemented linear regression and also learnt about SciPy.
In the third Assignment we are implementing logistic regression.
The fourth Assignment is going to be on Neural Networks.

These Assignment provided helps me a lot in grasping the concepts taught in the course.
